    "Information": "The College of Fine Arts building was intended as a text book on art and architecture.The buildingâ€™s exterior displays five large carved stone niches, each representing a chapter in architectural history: Medieval, Greek, Roman, Renaissance, and Non-Western. The Non-Western Niche features motifs which are Chinese, Indian, Mayan, Toltec, Cambodian and Islamic. Sculptor Archille Giammartini began carving the niches in 1912 but work was stopped and it did not commence again until 1989, under the initiative of Lowry Burgess, then Dean of the College of Fine Arts. Burgess secured funding of 1.1 million from Verner Purnell, who subsequently funded the Purnell Center for the Arts which houses the School of Drama and the Miller Gallery."
